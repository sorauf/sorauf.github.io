##The first of many thoughts

Beginnings, just the word can cause excitement, expectations and for some people like me a bunch of anxiety. 
I struggle with new projects, as in I have a large collection of unstarted ones. I call it my "doom pile" as a homage
to the 40k crowds habit of accumulating as many model kits as possible but never building them. You see I am that way.
I grab project ideas, heck sometimes I even plan them out complete with lists upon lists of steps and goals. However, usually thats the end.
So after more than a few months of it kicking in the back of my mind I decided to make the change, to start more not less. Face the fears and all that.
Which as we all know sometimes is easier said than done. For me I swirl into possiblity mode with thoughts of "what if I am judged?" or "what if it takes off?".
I often sit there thinking about if I will even want to finish it so why try? However I think now that if I try, that means at least I will know if I like it or not.
Learning new things is fun to me so I find myself looking at this as both a project to start, and an oppertunity to learn some new things. 

So I think the goal here for this blog will be to document everything and anything that comes to my mind. Pictures will be popping up, videos perhaps and
more often than not the most random of questions and ideas. So I look forward to sharing all of it with you readers. My next post will likely be 
about my iterests and maybe a pic to put a name to a face. In anycase, I encourage you to check back with me from time to time and see what I have done.
